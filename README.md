# r-analytics

Welcome to my R analytics portfolio — a curated collection of projects, scripts, and reports that demonstrate my applied skills in R programming, data wrangling, statistical modeling, and scientific writing.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`projects/`** — End-to-end analytical projects (e.g., OPMD analysis, COVID-19 published project)
- **`scripts/`** — Reusable R scripts and utilities
- **`reports/`** — Quarto/Markdown reports with code and interpretation
- **`pdfs/`** — Published reports or exported summaries

## 📈 Skills Demonstrated

- Data wrangling with `dplyr`, `tidyr`
- Data visualization using `ggplot2`
- Statistical modeling: linear models, mixed effects, risk analysis
- Reproducible reporting with `quarto` and `rmarkdown`
- Git/GitHub version control

## 📘 Example Projects

### 🔬 OPMD Analysis (Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders)
- Used longitudinal data to explore lesion progression
- Modeled risk factors with GLMs and mixed-effects models
- Produced publication-ready plots and reproducible reports

### 📊 General Scripts
- Utility functions for data import, cleaning, and exploration
- Modular code for Mixed effect model, EDA, and diagnostics
